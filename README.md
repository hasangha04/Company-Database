# Company-Database
This is a company database built using a binary search tree to emulate the structure of a company. 
The tree itself is built with basic C++ methods of pointers and traversals. 
However, an addition was made to the node struct to be able to add additional information for the given person in the company. 
In addition to the struct, there are also functions to allow the user to change the name of an employee and to print out the binary search tree 
in the three different traversal methods. There is also a check in the add function to make sure that the user is not adding an employee that is already in the 
binary search tree.
